# Welcome to the World of Machine Learning!

Hey devs!

I'm glad to be presenting to you that Enlight has a [Machine Learning](https://enlight.ml/ml) category where new tutorials will be posted regularly.

To start, you can learn how to [build a Neural Network](https://enlight.ml/build-a-neural-network) from scratch. It will take two inputs, which are the amount of time you study and the amount of time you sleep, to eventually calculate your test score for the following day. Neat, right? However, the best part is you'll be building a *flexible* and *adaptable* network that is ready to be used for all different types of applications!

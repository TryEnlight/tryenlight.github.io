## **FAQ**

### What is Enlight? 

Enlight is a compliation of articles and tutorials to enhance the process of learning to code. With topics spanning over many languages and technologies, Enlight is the home for everything development related.

### Why Enlight? 

A couple years ago, I started to learn web development. At first, I ended up taking many courses and reading books learning. However, I learned so many terms, objects, statements, etc. that I couldn't really implement them. Then, I started to make mini-projects by following tutorials online and scraping through code on GitHub. I believe that the best way to learn is to create. Make something cool. Then, with your newfound knowledge, make it even better. Trust me, you'll amaze yourself. 

### How can I contribute?

Enlight is open-source, which means we love contributors! Have a project on the web, a cool app you're making, or really anything useful? Share your knowledge! It doesn't have to be a specific programming language - just send us whatever you want to share!

- fork the [repo](https://github.com/tryenlight/enlight)
- in the contribute folder, place your project files (demo/source) and the tutorial text.
- submit a pull request

if you don't want to go through GitHub, you can **[email](mailto:hi@shamdasani.org)** me your project+tutorial.
